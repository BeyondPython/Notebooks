These functions are self-explanatory. We're adding a title, x axis label, and y axis label. As mentioned with the `plot()` function above, there are also a couple of arguments for each of these. The arguments are the text that should be displayed and the font size to use. Lastly, the fontsize was also updated for the legend to improve readability. Note that `plt.legend()` could be used to create the legend or change the legend labels, but the dataframe `plot()` function took care of that for us so we only used the fontsize argument here.\n",

When we called the `plot()` function, it was used on a variable that we created. `datasheet.plot()` works, but `pd.plot()` would not have worked. So why does `plt.xlabel()` work? A variable was never defined for the `plt` module. This works because the creators of matplotlib.pyplot were trying to mimic the command style behavior that people are familar with in MATLAB. In the background, the matplotlib.pyplot keeps track of the current figure. After calling `datasheet.plot()`, a reference to that figure was created and any call using `plt` will operate on the current figure. Defining the current figure explicitly is possible, but isn't necessary in this simple example. We'll take a look at a case where it is necessary in the next example.\n",

In the jupyter notebook, the last function will print to the output if left unassigned. The semicolon is just an easy way to supress this output."

Also note that the function is no longer just `ylabel()`, but has changed to `set_ylabel()`. This is because of the `ax` object is different from the `plt` object and has different functions.

There are a couple of formatting instructions, but the majority of the work was done by using `seaborn` (aliased as `sns`). One of the handy features of seaborn is it's ability to automatically add labels. In this case the X and Y axes are labeled appropriately because the data columns have descriptive headers. Even better is that a legend for the two different substrates being analyzed was automatically added.\n",

In that case, `seaborn` does its best to create a plot, but if you have too many columns like in the `nanodata`, then the plot won't be all that useful. So we give seaborn a bit more information to select the data that we want to see, by passing these arguments:\n",

This is one of those features that really makes seaborn stand out as a powerful plotting module. By setting `hue=\"Substrate\"` we've told seaborn to group the data by the substrate column. That means our `nanodata` dataframe will be grouped by the unique values in the Substrate column, which are _ITO_ and _a-Si_. \n",

Well this time we are doing something a bit more complex and we need to keep track of the figure and axes ourselves.

    "Here we've encounted another `for` loop. This `for` loop is much more exciting then the first one because we are using one of the most useful features of `pandas` and that is the `groupby()` function. Similar to how `hue` worked in the earlier seaborn examples, the `groupby()` command will separate the dataframe by the unique values in the entered column. So by using `groupby('Ag Thickness (nm))`, we are creating subsets of the data for each value in _Ag Thickness (nm)_. The ebook will contain examples of how these dataframes are segmented to help provide a visual understanding of how function like `groupby()` work. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `groupby()` function can then be used with a `for` loop to do an operation on each group of data. When using `groupby()` in this manner, it will return a `name` and the `group`. The name is simply the value of the specified column for the group and the `group` is the subset of data.\n",

    "group=aSi[aSi['Ag Thickness (nm)'] == 6]\n",
    "```\n",

As mentioned earlier, grouping, indexing, pivoting, and other data manipulation operations are an important part of analyzing data. These topics tend to be confusing for begineers. This guide isn't meant to provide a full description of these operations, but this is a topic that will be fully covered in the ebook.\n",

The `distplot()` function doesn't need the `data=` that we used earlier because there is only one variable being plotted. We've also added the `ax=ax1` to tell Python which plot to put the data in. Notice that the next for loop uses `ax=ax2`. Lastly, this time we had to modify the label for readability.\n",

Remember that the `seaborn` and `pandas` plotting function are built on that library, so their font size will also change. This is a useful feature because the font size tends to be a bit small when building plots for presenting. So keep this command handy when you need to improve the readibility of all your plot labels and titles. Note that this command modifies the default font size, any font sizes that are explicity set, like the title in the above code, will not be modified."
